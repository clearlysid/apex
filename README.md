# Apex Obsidian Theme

This is a simple, distraction free theme for the powerful writing app [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md). Me and [Vignesh](https://twitter.com/c_m_vignesh) built this as a passion project over a weekend. It currently works best on macOS, but we will fix up any issues and publish updates to support other platforms too.

## TODOs

-   [ ] Finalize and bundle the fonts within the theme
-   [ ] Improve colours in fullscreen mode
-   [ ] Check theme on Windows and Linux
-   [ ] Replace some characters with alternate glyphs
